# Testcase Example:  '"anagram"\n"nagaram"'
#
# Given two strings s and tÂ , write a function to determine if t is an anagram
# of s.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
# Output: true
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
# Output: false
# 
# 
# Note:
# You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.
# 
# Follow up:
# What if the inputs contain unicode characters? How would you adapt your
# solution to such case?
