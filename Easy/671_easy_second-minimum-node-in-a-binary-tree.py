#
# Given a non-empty special binary tree consisting of nodes with the
# non-negative value, where each node in this tree has exactly two or zero
# sub-node. If the node has two sub-nodes, then this node's value is the
# smaller value among its two sub-nodes. More formally, the property root.val =
# min(root.left.val, root.right.val) always holds.
# 
# Given such a binary tree, you need to output the second minimum value in the
# set made of all the nodes' value in the whole tree.
# 
# If no such second minimum value exists, output -1 instead.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: 
# ⁠   2
# ⁠  / \
# ⁠ 2   5
# ⁠    / \
# ⁠   5   7
# 
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The smallest value is 2, the second smallest value is 5.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: 
# ⁠   2
# ⁠  / \
# ⁠ 2   2
# 
# Output: -1
# Explanation: The smallest value is 2, but there isn't any second smallest
# value.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    
    def findSecondMinimumValue(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        self.min = float("Inf")
        self.min1 = root.val
        self.min2(root)
        return self.min if self.min < float("Inf") else -1
        
    def min2(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        if root:
            if self.min1 < root.val < self.min:
                self.min = root.val
            elif root.val == self.min1:
                self.min2(root.left)
                self.min2(root.right)
